## Project Overview

The Euro Stoxx 50 represents the performance of the top 50 blue-chip stocks from various Eurozone countries. Investing in such a diverse portfolio can be challenging, but this project will provide you with insights and tools to optimize your investment strategy.

## Key Steps

### Data Collection

We start by collecting historical stock price data for the Euro Stoxx 50 components. This data forms the foundation of our analysis.

### Portfolio Selection

Using the UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) algorithm, we identify the five optimum stocks for trading. These stocks will constitute the core of our portfolio.

### Correlation Analysis

To minimize risk, we conduct a correlation analysis of the remaining stocks in the Euro Stoxx 50. This analysis helps us identify the least correlated stock to our portfolio.

### Hedging Strategy

With the least correlated stock identified, we develop a hedging strategy to protect our portfolio against market fluctuations. This strategy is essential for managing risk effectively.

### Performance Evaluation

We assess the performance of our portfolio and hedging strategy, considering factors such as returns, risk, and volatility. This evaluation provides valuable insights for refining your investment approach.
